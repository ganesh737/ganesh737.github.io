Hi,

My name is Ganesh. I am a simple, straight forward, and result oriented person looking to do something meaningfull with my skills.


I'm currently working as Technical Expert at [RBEI](https://www.bosch-india-software.com/en/our-company/about-us/).

My current focus is on SoftWare Update Solutions for [Infotainment devices](https://www.bosch-mobility-solutions.com/en/).

So my primary work areas are -
* C++ Applications for Genivi Linux
* Busybox and Lua scripting for devices
* Tooling for Update Medium generation (stick, delta, and production images)
* Peripheral Updaters

I am currently reading up Artificial Intelligence.

My personal experiences are shared in [my beat of life](https://ganesh737.github.io/my-beat-of-life/)
